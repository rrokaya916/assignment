"The first memory: A beautiful sunrise I watched last summer." 
"The second memory: Laughing uncontrollably with my best friend." 
"The third memory: Achieving a personal goal I worked hard for." 
"The fourth memory: A peaceful walk in the rain, feeling refreshed." 
"The fifth memory: Watching the stars at night and feeling infinite."
